## Development without docker

This app may be run without using Docker. Run all commands from the root of the
project, from a terminal:

| Command             | Action                                               |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm install`      | Installs dependencies                                |
| `pnpm dev`          | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`          |
| `pnpm build`        | Build your production site to `./dist/`              |
| `pnpm preview`      | Preview your build locally, before deploying         |
| `pnpm astro ...`    | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro preview`   |
| `pnpm astro --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                         |
| `pnpm tsc`          | Run the TypeScript compiler with any compiler option |

## Development with docker

For local dev, build and run the project by running `docker compose up --build`.

To run a production build, run:
`docker build -t website . && docker run website pnpm run build`.

To run a production build and deploy the build:
`docker build -t website . && docker run website pnpm run build && pnpm run deploy`

TODO:

- [ ] configure the container for local development.
  - [ ] may need to remove the following from `.dockerignore` so we can access
        them during local dev:
    - `.git`
    - `README.md`
    - `LICENSE`
- Compare existing `Dockerfile` with the one generated by `docker init`:

```Dockerfile
